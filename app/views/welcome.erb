      <p>In this space you will be able to journal your prayers, look back at the way God has worked in your life, and edit or delete if you need to.</p>
     
  
      <p>If this is your first time journaling, don't frett if you're unsure what to write or how much to write. Start off with a sentence or two giving thanks, confessing, or adding a verse and how it applies to your life today.</p>
